# Machine learning interview questions

**Q:** Explain the difference between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. Can you provide real-world examples of each?

- *Supervised learning* involves training a model on a labeled dataset, meaning each training example is paired with an output label. A real-world example is spam classification for emails.
- *Unsupervised learning* finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data, which is unlabeled. An example is market basket analysis in retail, where you identify product items that frequently co-occur in transactions.
- *Reinforcement learning* is about taking suitable action to maximize reward in a particular situation; it is employed in various fields, especially in robotics for task automation, and in gaming, e.g., AlphaGo.

**Q:** How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?

You have several options: 
- Imputing data using methods like mean/mode/median imputation, predictive modeling, or using algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors;
- Removing data, which involves deleting rows/columns with missing data; 
- Using algorithms that support missing values, like XGBoost.
It's also crucial to understand the source of missing or corrupt data and whether the data is missing at random or if it's a systematic loss.

**Q:** What is the bias-variance trade-off in machine learning?

Bias is the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn. Variance is the amount that the estimate of the target function will change given different training data. High bias can cause an algorithm to miss relevant relations between features and target outputs (underfitting); high variance can cause overfitting, which is modeling the random noise in the training data. The trade-off is about finding the right balance so that the model generalizes well to new data.

---

**Q:** Describe how a decision tree works and how you would prevent overfitting.

A decision tree makes decisions by splitting data based on certain conditions, creating a tree-like model of decisions. To prevent overfitting:
- Prune the tree by removing branches that use features with low importance;
- Set a minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree;
- Use ensemble methods like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.

---

**Q:** Explain the purpose of a training set, a validation set, and a test set in a machine learning model.

- The *training set* is used to train the model's parameters.
- The *validation set* is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the model fit during the tuning of the model's hyperparameters and can be used for regularization to avoid overfitting. 
- The *test set* is used to provide an unbiased evaluation of the final model fit. It's not used during training and thus serves as a final judge on the model's performance.

---

**Q:** What is cross-validation, and why is it useful?

Cross-validation is a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models on a limited data sample. The most common method is k-fold cross-validation, where the dataset is divided into k subsets, and the model is trained k times, each time using a different subset as the test set and the remaining data as the training set. This method is useful because it provides a robust estimate of the model's performance.

---

**Q:** Can you explain what precision and recall are? In what scenarios might you prioritize one over the other?

- *Precision* is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives. High precision relates to low false positive rate.
- *Recall* (Sensitivity) is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all actual positives. 
You'd prioritize precision in scenarios where false positives are more concerning (e.g., email spam detection) and recall in scenarios where false negatives are more concerning (e.g., disease detection).

---

**Q:** What are some common feature selection methods used in machine learning?

Common methods include:
- Statistical methods (like Chi-Squared);
- Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE);
- Using feature importance from tree-based classifiers;
- L1 (Lasso) regularization;
- Correlation matrices with heatmap.
Feature selection helps in reducing overfitting, improving accuracy, and reducing training time.

---

**Q:** Explain what regularization is and why it is useful.

Regularization adds a penalty to the different parameters of the machine learning model to reduce the freedom of the model, hence avoiding overfitting. This is done by adding a complexity term to the objective function. L1 regularization (Lasso) adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients, and L2 regularization (Ridge) adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients.

---

**Q:** How do ensemble methods work, and why might they be preferred over individual models?

Ensemble methods combine multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain better predictive performance. Techniques include:
- Bagging (e.g., Random Forest), which builds multiple models (typically of the same type) from different subsamples of the training dataset.
- Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, AdaBoost), which trains models sequentially, each trying to correct the errors from the previous one.
- Stacking, which involves training a learning algorithm to combine the predictions of several other learning algorithms.
Ensemble methods are often more robust and accurate as they combine the strengths of multiple models and can deliver superior results on complex problems.

## Advanced:

1. **How do you handle class imbalance in a dataset, and why might traditional performance metrics be misleading in such cases?**

Handling class imbalance in a dataset is a critical aspect of training machine learning models, particularly in domains like medical diagnostics, fraud detection, and anomaly detection, where the disproportionate class distribution can significantly skew the model's performance and interpretation. Addressing this issue involves a mix of data-level approaches and algorithm-level methods, as well as adopting more nuanced performance metrics.

1. **Data-Level Approaches**:

   a. **Resampling Techniques**: 
      - *Oversampling the minority class*: Techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) or ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling) are widely used. They generate synthetic samples in a feature space to augment the minority class. However, it's crucial to ensure that oversampling doesn't lead to overfitting due to duplication of samples or too-close synthetic examples.
      - *Undersampling the majority class*: Techniques like NearMiss, Tomek Links, or Condensed Nearest Neighbours reduce the number of samples in the majority class. The risk here is the potential loss of informative examples, reducing the model's ability to generalize.

   b. **Creating Balanced Batches for Training**: When using mini-batch gradient descent-based methods (common in deep learning), ensuring each batch of data fed to the model during training has a balanced representation of classes can help. This is known as "balanced batching" or "class-balanced batching."

2. **Algorithm-Level Methods**:

   a. **Cost-sensitive Training**: This involves adjusting the algorithm to make misclassification of minority classes more 'costly' relative to the majority class. It can be achieved by assigning different weights to classes or by modifying the loss function (e.g., focal loss, especially useful in object detection tasks with class imbalance).

   b. **Ensemble Methods**: Techniques like Balanced Random Forests or RUSBoost (combining undersampling with boosting) can improve performance on imbalanced datasets. They inherently handle imbalance better due to their nature of constructing multiple learners with resampled data or weighted strategies.

3. **Performance Metrics**:

   - Traditional metrics like accuracy can be incredibly misleading with imbalanced datasets because they can reflect the underlying class distribution rather than the model's ability to predict the minority class. For instance, a dataset with 95% negative examples could yield a model with 95% accuracy by merely predicting every instance as the majority class, even though it fails to identify any positive instance.
   
   - Therefore, metrics that provide more insight into class-specific performance are essential:
      - *Precision, Recall, and F1-score*: These metrics, especially when viewed through a class-specific lens or in a macro/micro-averaged manner, provide more insight into the performance on each class. The F1-score's harmonic mean nature makes it sensitive to class imbalances, thereby offering a more realistic performance picture.
      - *ROC-AUC and PR-AUC*: The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve summarizes the trade-off between the True Positive Rate (TPR) and False Positive Rate (FPR), insensitive to class imbalance. However, in severe class imbalance scenarios, Precision-Recall AUC (PR-AUC) becomes more informative as it focuses on the positive class's performance in different precision-recall trade-offs.
      - *Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)*: This is a balanced measure even when classes are of very different sizes. It's considered one of the best metrics for binary classification problems with imbalanced datasets because it returns a value between -1 and +1, where +1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 no better than random prediction, and -1 indicates total disagreement between prediction and observation.
      - *Cohenâ€™s Kappa*: It measures inter-annotator agreement for categorical items and is adjusted for chance, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets. It is more robust than simple accuracy as it considers the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance.

Remember, the choice of method to handle class imbalance is highly contingent on the specific problem, the dataset's characteristics, and the computational resources at disposal. Moreover, maintaining a clear understanding of the problem's domain and the cost of different types of misclassifications is crucial in guiding both the choice of handling techniques and performance metrics.

**2.** What is the difference between Parametric and Non-parametric models? Provide examples of scenarios where each would be applicable.

In machine learning, the distinction between parametric and non-parametric models is fundamental, as it influences not only the approach to training and inference but also the assumptions the model makes about the underlying data and system it's meant to represent. 

1. **Parametric Models:**

**Definition and Characteristics:**
- Parametric models assume a fixed, predefined form for the functional relationship between inputs and outputs. They characterize the data based on a set of parameters of known form. The number of parameters is independent of the number of training samples.
- These models make strong assumptions about the structure of the data. The advantage is simplicity, speed, and efficiency, but the risk is that if the chosen form is too far from the true function, the model won't be able to fit the data well, regardless of the data amount - a situation referred to as "model misspecification."

**Examples and Scenarios:**
- Linear regression, logistic regression, and linear SVMs are classic examples. These are suitable in scenarios with limited data, where overfitting is a concern, or when interpretability is important. For instance, in financial forecasting or biomedical statistics, where interpretability and a clear understanding of the relationship between variables are often required, parametric models are very relevant.
- Deep learning models like CNNs and RNNs, despite having large numbers of parameters, are still considered parametric because they have a fixed architecture trained for a task.

2. **Non-Parametric Models:**

**Definition and Characteristics:**
- Non-parametric models don't assume a fixed form for the function they're learning. Instead, they make fewer assumptions about the data's structure and can adapt to various complexities and patterns in the data. The number of parameters grows with the amount of training data, making them more flexible.
- They are particularly useful when there's little domain knowledge about the underlying relationships or when the data's structure is thought to be highly complex or non-linear. However, they generally require a larger amount of data, more computational resources, and can easily overfit if not properly regularized or validated.

**Examples and Scenarios:**
- Decision trees, random forests, and kernel-based methods like the Gaussian processes and kernel SVMs are examples. They are applicable in complex, real-world scenarios where relationships between variables are unknown or non-linear. For instance, in image recognition or natural language processing, where data patterns are highly intricate and can't be distilled down to simple equations, non-parametric models thrive.
- K-nearest neighbors (KNN) is another example, often used in recommendation systems where the objective is to capture complex preferences and behaviors without predetermining the relationships.

**Choosing Between Parametric and Non-Parametric:**
The choice depends on various factors:

- **Data Volume:** Non-parametric models are more data-hungry. With small datasets, they might overfit, and parametric models are usually more effective.
  
- **Interpretability:** If you need a model that stakeholders can understand and interpret, parametric models often offer a clearer relationship between input and output.

- **Performance Expectations:** For complex tasks where high accuracy is required, and there's plenty of data, non-parametric models are often the go-to despite their computational demands.

- **Computational Resources:** Parametric models are less demanding in terms of memory and compute power, making them suitable for environments with resource constraints.

- **Domain Knowledge:** If you have substantial domain knowledge, you might be able to design a parametric model that incorporates that knowledge. In contrast, with little or no prior knowledge, a non-parametric model might uncover the underlying structure more effectively.

In practice, it's also common to use semi-parametric approaches, which combine both philosophies to leverage the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of non-parametric models. One such example is the use of Gaussian processes with a parametric mean function, or deep learning models that are augmented or regularized using non-parametric techniques.

**3.** Explain the Bias-Variance Tradeoff in machine learning models. Can you provide an example of when you would prefer a model with higher bias over one with higher variance?

The Bias-Variance Tradeoff is a central concept in machine learning that offers a formal understanding of the balance between underfitting and overfitting in model predictions. It's intrinsically linked to the generalization capabilities of machine learning models.

**1. Understanding Bias and Variance:**

- **Bias** refers to the error due to overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm, leading to the model's inability to capture the true relationship in data (underfitting). High-bias models are often too rigid or simple, signifying that they can't learn the complex patterns from the data, potentially ignoring relevant relations between features and outcomes.

- **Variance** refers to the error due to too much complexity in the learning algorithm, leading the model to capture the random noise in the data as if they were part of the desired output (overfitting). High-variance models are often too flexible, meaning they model the random noise in the data, not just the intended outputs.

The tradeoff posits that as you decrease bias (making your model more complex to adapt better to the data), you'll usually increase variance (your model starts to learn not just the actual relationships but also the noise). Conversely, as you decrease variance by simplifying your model, you're prone to increase bias. This is the "tradeoff": it's challenging to decrease both simultaneously.

**2. When Higher Bias is Preferred:**

A scenario in which you'd prefer a model with higher bias (i.e., a simpler model) over a model with higher variance (i.e., a more complex model) usually involves considerations around data volume, computational constraints, interpretability, and the risk of overfitting. Hereâ€™s an example:

**Scenario: Predictive Healthcare Analytics in a Small Clinic**

Imagine you're developing a model for a small healthcare clinic to predict the likelihood of patients being readmitted within 30 days after discharge. Your model will be based on patient records and will inform doctors about potential high-risk patients.

**Factors leading to the preference for a higher-bias model:**

- **Limited Data:** The clinic has a relatively small number of patient records. A complex model (high variance) would likely overfit to this limited data, making predictions less reliable.
  
- **Interpretability:** Doctors and staff are more likely to trust and act upon the model if they understand it. A simple model (higher bias) is more interpretable and could be explained in terms of a small number of influential factors, whereas a complex model (like a deep neural network) would resemble a "black box".
  
- **Computationally Efficient:** The clinic has limited resources for high-power computation. A simpler model requires less computational power to train and use.
  
- **Generalization:** With limited data, a complex model might perform exceedingly well on the training data but fail to generalize to new patients (high variance). A simpler model might not perform as well on the training data but is more likely to generalize better to unseen data.

- **Quick Decisions:** In healthcare, timely interventions are crucial. A simpler model allows for faster computation, providing doctors with quicker insights.

- **Regulatory and Ethical Considerations:** In many jurisdictions, healthcare models need to be interpretable for regulatory approval, and from an ethical standpoint, itâ€™s easier to catch and address biases in simpler models.

In this scenario, a logistic regression (a high-bias, low-variance model) might be preferred over, say, a complex neural network or a highly-tuned ensemble method. The logistic regression model, while potentially underfitting the data slightly, would be much less likely to overfit, would be interpretable, and would generalize better to new patients seen by the clinic. The emphasis here is on reliable, understandable, and generalizable predictions over possibly more accurate but less trustworthy predictions that a high-variance model might provide.

Adjusting the bias or variance in a neural network (NN) involves tweaking its complexity, the amount of training data, and the training techniques. Here are specific strategies to control bias and variance:

**Reducing Bias:**

1. **Increase Model Complexity:**
   - **More Layers/Neurons:** Adding more layers or neurons to your network (i.e., increasing the network's capacity) allows the model to learn more complex functions and reduces bias.
   - **Complex Architectures:** Use more sophisticated architectures (e.g., different types of layers like convolutional or recurrent layers for specific data types).

2. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Adding new features or transforming existing ones can help the model capture more information and relationships in the data, thereby reducing bias.

3. **Reduce Regularization:**
   - Regularization techniques (e.g., L1/L2 regularization, dropout) are used to prevent overfitting. However, if a model has high bias, reducing or removing regularization can help the model fit the training data better.

**Reducing Variance:**

1. **Get More Data:**
   - More training data helps the model generalize better to unseen data, reducing variance.
   
2. **Data Augmentation:**
   - If collecting more data isn't an option, data augmentation techniques (like image rotations, flipping, or text augmentations) can artificially expand the dataset.

3. **Simplify The Model:**
   - **Fewer Layers/Neurons:** Reducing the network's capacity can prevent it from modeling the random noise.
   - **Pruning:** Techniques like network pruning, which eliminate unnecessary neurons or connections, can simplify the model.

4. **Increase Regularization:**
   - **Dropout:** Randomly setting a fraction of input units to 0 at each update during training time to prevent co-adaptation of hidden units.
   - **L1/L2 regularization (weight decay):** Adding a regularization term to the networkâ€™s loss function to constrain the weights.
   - **Early Stopping:** This is where training is halted once performance on a validation set stops improving, or even starts to degrade.
   - **Batch Normalization:** It helps generalize the model better and also can have a regularization effect.

5. **Use Ensemble Methods:**
   - Techniques like bagging or boosting combine multiple models to average out their predictions, thereby reducing variance. For neural networks, model ensembling can be done by training different networks independently and then averaging their predictions, or by using techniques akin to dropout at inference time.

6. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   - Optimize hyperparameters using cross-validation. The learning rate, batch size, number of epochs, and other factors can significantly influence variance.

7. **Noise Reduction in Data:**
   - Cleaning the data to remove outliers or errors can help the model focus on the true patterns in the data.

**Balancing Bias and Variance:**

Achieving a balance is often done iteratively: you might start with a simpler model (to avoid overfitting), evaluate bias and variance by looking at the training error rates (high error indicates high bias) and validation error rates (a significant gap between training and validation error indicates high variance), and then adjust accordingly. This process often involves a lot of trial and error and requires a careful examination of learning curves to understand if your model is underfitting, overfitting, or has found a good balance.

Remember, the goal is to achieve a balance where you have acceptable bias and variance, leading to a model that generalizes well to new, unseen data. This is often reflected in having minimal differences between training and validation errors (generalization) while keeping both errors low.

**3.** What is the role of the cost function in machine learning? Can you discuss a scenario where you would need to design a custom cost function instead of using a predefined one?

The cost function, also known as the loss function or objective function, is a fundamental component in machine learning and plays several critical roles:

1. **Quantifying Error:** It quantifies the discrepancy or error between the predicted values by the model and the actual values in the dataset. This quantification is crucial because it provides a measurable way to understand how well (or poorly) the model is performing.

2. **Learning Signal:** During the training process, particularly in supervised learning, the cost function provides a signal that guides the optimization algorithm (like gradient descent). By calculating the gradient of the cost function, the training algorithm can adjust the model's parameters in a direction that minimally decreases error.

3. **Model Evaluation and Comparison:** It serves as a criterion for evaluating the performance of different models. By comparing the cost functions' values for different models or different sets of hyperparameters, practitioners can select the model that performs best.

4. **Regularization:** Cost functions can also include terms that penalize complexity to help prevent overfitting. This is where concepts like L1 and L2 regularization come into play, adding a component to the cost function that depends on the weights of the model.

While there are many standard cost functions available (like mean squared error, cross-entropy, etc.), there are scenarios where designing a custom cost function becomes necessary:

**Scenario for Custom Cost Function: Imbalanced Classification with High Cost of Misclassification**

Imagine you're building a machine learning model to predict whether a patient requires an urgent medical intervention based on various health indicators. Your dataset is imbalanced â€” only a small fraction of patients require urgent care. Furthermore, the cost of false negatives (failing to identify patients who need urgent care) is very high, as it could potentially result in loss of life, while the cost of false positives (unnecessarily flagging patients) is comparatively low.

In this case, standard cost functions like cross-entropy might not be suitable because they treat all types of errors equally, whereas you want your model to be particularly sensitive to reducing false negatives. Here, you might create a custom cost function that assigns a higher penalty to false negatives.

One approach could be to use a weighted form of cross-entropy that has an additional term or multiplier for the class of interest (patients requiring urgent intervention). The custom loss function would look something like this:

```python
def custom_loss(y_true, y_pred):
    penalty = 10  # This is a hyperparameter and would need to be determined based on the specific context.
    loss = -torch.mean(penalty * y_true * torch.log(y_pred) + (1 - y_true) * torch.log(1 - y_pred))
    return loss
```

This function increases the loss contribution from false negatives, making them more "costly" to the model. As a result, during training, the model will focus more on correctly classifying the minority class, potentially at the expense of increasing false positives, which is acceptable in this context due to the asymmetry in the costs associated with different types of classification errors.

In practice, the design of such a custom cost function would involve domain knowledge, experimentation, and validation to ensure it aligns with the real-world costs and benefits, and ultimately improves the decision-making process.

**6.** What is the difference between L1 and L2 regularization? How do they affect the bias and variance of a machine learning model?

L1 and L2 regularization are techniques used primarily to add a penalty to the loss function, which discourages the weights from reaching large values. These methods are a cornerstone of the machine learning practice because they're effective at combating overfitting, which improves the model's generalization to unseen data.

**L1 Regularization (Lasso):**

The L1 regularization adds a penalty equal to the absolute value of the magnitude of coefficients. This type of regularization can lead to sparse models with few coefficients; some might be exactly zero. It's useful when we want to create a parsimonious model that retains only the most influential features.

The cost function modified by L1 regularization (also known as Lasso) is:

$$
J(\theta) = \text{MSE}(\theta) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\theta_i|
$$


where:
- $J(\theta)$ is the cost function.
- $\text{MSE}(\theta)$ represents the mean squared error, a measure of the modelâ€™s prediction error.
- $\theta_i$ represents each model parameter (weight).
- $\lambda$ is the regularization parameter controlling the amount of regularization (higher $\lambda$ means more regularization).
- The summation is over all the weights $n$ in the model.

**L2 Regularization (Ridge):**

L2 regularization adds a penalty equal to the square of the magnitude of coefficients. This approach encourages smaller weights, effectively distributing the "importance" across features and mitigating the impact of any single feature.

The cost function modified by L2 regularization (also known as Ridge regression) is:

$$
J(\theta) = \text{MSE}(\theta) + \lambda \sum_{i=1}^{n} \theta_i^2
$$

where the symbols have the same meaning as in L1. The key difference is the square of the weights $\theta_i^2$, meaning larger weights are penalized more than smaller ones compared to L1.

**Why called "Weight Decay"?**

The term "weight decay" is more commonly used in the context of L2 regularization, even though the concept can extend to any form of regularization that reduces the weights' magnitude.

The reason it's called "weight decay" is that, during the training process, the regularization term's effect is to "decay" the weights towards zero (or make the weights smaller in magnitude). In other words, without regularization, the weights would take on values that minimize the loss function, considering the training data alone. With regularization, the loss function includes a penalty for large weights, and thus the optimization process (such as gradient descent) will push the weights towards smaller values (i.e., towards zero) to minimize this new, regularized loss function.

When using gradient descent, this "decay" is literal in each step; a portion of the weight value is subtracted during the update. Specifically, in L2 regularization, when you perform a gradient descent update, you subtract a portion of the weight itself from the weight (which is why larger weights decay more rapidly). The update rule looks something like this:

$$
\theta_i = \theta_i - \alpha \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \theta_i} J(\theta) + \lambda \theta_i\right)
$$

where:
- $\theta_i$ is the weight being updated.
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate.
- $J(\theta)$ is the loss function.
- $\lambda$ is the regularization strength.

Here, the $\lambda \theta_i$ term is the regularization term, and you can see that a fraction of the weight $\theta_i$ itself is being subtracted during the update, causing it to "decay" towards zero.

PyTorch doesn't have a direct way to add L1 regularization, but it can be done by adding the L1 loss to the cost manually. L2 regularization, on the other hand, is straightforward and can be added using the 'weight_decay' parameter in PyTorch's optimizers.

First, let's set up a simple neural network:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define a simple sequential model
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(10, 5),  # input layer
    nn.ReLU(),         # activation function
    nn.Linear(5, 1)    # output layer
)
```

**1. L1 Regularization**

Since PyTorch doesn't have built-in L1 regularization for the optimizer, we need to add the L1 norm of the weights to the loss function manually.

```python
# L1 Regularization
l1_lambda = 0.001  # you can change this value

# Loss function
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)  # you can change learning rate

# Assume `inputs` and `targets` are your input and output training data, and model is your neural network
# You should add your data loading and preprocessing steps here
inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)  # example inputs
targets = torch.randn(64, 1)  # example targets

optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

# L1 regularization
l1_norm = sum(p.abs().sum() for p in model.parameters())
loss = loss + l1_lambda * l1_norm

loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

**2. L2 Regularization**

For L2 regularization, also known as weight decay, PyTorch makes it simple by allowing you to add it as a parameter in the optimizer.

```python
# L2 Regularization
l2_lambda = 0.01  # this is the weight decay parameter for L2 regularization

# Loss function
criterion = nn.MSELoss()

# Optimizer with weight decay
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001, weight_decay=l2_lambda)

# Assume `inputs` and `targets` are your input and output training data, and model is your neural network
# You should add your data loading and preprocessing steps here
inputs = torch.randn(64, 10)  # example inputs
targets = torch.randn(64, 1)  # example targets

optimizer.zero_grad()
outputs = model(inputs)
loss = criterion(outputs, targets)

loss.backward()
optimizer.step()
```

In these examples, `torch.randn(64, 10)` and `torch.randn(64, 1)` are just illustrative placeholders for your inputs and targets, assuming a batch size of 64, 10 input features, and 1 target. In practice, you'd replace these with your actual data, loaded appropriately for training.

Also, these scripts are simplified and do not include details such as model evaluation, data loading, or the training loop. You'd need to expand them with actual data and potentially multiple epochs of training, validation, logging, etc., for a complete training script.
